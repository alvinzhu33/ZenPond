Alvin

1/19:
* Modified the method for rotating the fish.
* Bug of twitchy fish was introduced.
* Made the fish swim according to its orientation (the forward direction matches up to its head)[Fixed bug where the fish faced one direction but moved in another]
* Made the fish more textured (using transparency, I made the fish blend a little with the direction for better visuals when under the lilypads)
* Adapted the code so we can have multiple fishes in the pond at one time easily in the setup
* Fixed the boundaries so they function more consistently

1/20:
* Attempted to implement a growing function
* Attempt went horribly worng; commented out for now, will try again tomorrow

1/21:
* Got the growing function to work
* The fish still grows a little too large (either that or must make eyes scalable as well
* Discovered that the wagging function becomes more off the longer the length


*Random Notes*

Goldfish: ~10 in (half the size of Koifish)
Koi Fish: ~20 in (little shorter and skinnier) than catfish
Catfish: ~24 in (largest and fattest fish)
