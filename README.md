**Changelog**

Alvin

1/19:
* Modified the method for rotating the fish.
* Bug of twitchy fish was introduced.
* Made the fish swim according to its orientation (the forward direction matches up to its head)[Fixed bug where the fish faced one direction but moved in another]
* Made the fish more textured (using transparency, I made the fish blend a little with the direction for better visuals when under the lilypads)
* Adapted the code so we can have multiple fishes in the pond at one time easily in the setup
* Fixed the boundaries so they function more consistently
1/20:
* Attempted to implement a growing function
* Attempt went horribly wrong; took it out for now, will try again next time

1/20:
- Changed order that objects are drawn for organization
- Create an individual movement for the fish tail (using booleans to reverse the waving of the tail), and an function to change the coordinates of the position of the center bezier.


*Random Notes*

Goldfish: ~10 in (half the size of Koifish)
Koi Fish: ~20 in (little shorter and skinnier) than catfish
Catfish: ~24 in (largest and fattest fish)
